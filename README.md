## Definition

This project is done in vanilla web technologies: JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML, PHP and SQL, this should be
in a sense, a reflection of the timeline of my learning journey, first, I should get the application
to essentially function, to satisfy the theoretical client, and next, I should recursively improve
it by adding security features: authentication, form sanitization ...etc, UI/UX improvements, and also continuously improve
code structure by continually refactor to reflect OOP best practices and a healthy non-forced choice of design
patterns.
Unit testing is the next plausible step, as we are approaching the theoretical phase of release, though
experts might argue that it needs to be done before starting to write the actual code.
After adding unit testing, and only after that, should I jump to docker image building
and application deploymenet in docker.
If the afore mentioned skills are mastered, I can say with a good degree of confidence, that I can apply
for the role of a junior dev.
estimated timeline: [3 - 9] * months.
